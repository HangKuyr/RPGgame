This repository has the objective of implementing a game named Tales of Nothing.
It's battle system and characters were inspired in the RPG game called Dungeons and Dragons.

COMMANDS TO RUN THE PROGRAM:

MAKE ALL - compilation of the executable that runs the game
./game - run the executable that executes the game

MAKE TEST - compilation of the executable that runs the test unity
./game_test - run the executable that executes the tests for the classes created

The makefile was configured in a way that the user won't need to install any third  part softwares, 
since the boost library needed is include in the repository.

READ THIS IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS COMPILING YOUR PROGRAM

If you encounters compilation problems, it might be caused by the boost library, since we tested in some computers
but there's always a chance it won't work in another one.
You should carry out the following instructions:
1. Enter your terminal and paste:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install boost
2. So go to the makefile situated in the folder called RPG and edit it:
In the line 11 you will find : BOOST = ./third_parties/boost_1_66_0
Delete it and write in it's place:  BOOST = /usr/boost
